    <h3 id="mcal">1. MACHINE CODE AND ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE (1940s-1950s):</h3>
    <p>Early programming involved writing insructions in machine code or assembly language specific to the computer
        architecture.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="f">2. FORTRAN (1957):</h3>
    <p>Developed for scientific and engineering computations, Fortran was the first high-level programming language. It
        introduced the concept of compilers.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="l">3. LISP (1958):</h3>
    <p>LISP (List Processing) was designed for symbolic computing and artificial intelligence.It introduced concepts
        like garbage collection.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="c">4. COBOL (1959):</h3>
    <p> COBOL (Common Business-Orienter Language) aimed at business data processing. It emphasized readability and was
        widely used in finance. </p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="a">5. ALGOL (1958-60):</h3>
    <p>ALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language) influenced many languages and introduced block structures and lexical scoping.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="b">6. BASIC (1964):</h3>
    <p>Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code was designed for educational purposes. It played a crucial role
        in introducing programming to non-specialists.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="p">7. Pascal (1970):</h3>
    <p>Pascal, designed for teaching programming, emphasized structured programming principles.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="c">8. C (1972):</h3>
    <p>C, developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, had low-level features and became the basis for the Unix operating
        system. It influenced many subsequent languages.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="c++">9. C++ (1983):</h3>
    <p>An extension of C, C++ introduced object-oriented programming (OOP) features, making it versatile for both
        procedural and OOP paradigms.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="py">10. Python (1991):</h3>
    <p>Python prioritized readability and ease of use. Its simplicity and versatility contributed to its widesread
        adoption.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="j">11. Java (1995):</h3>
    <p>Java, with its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, brought platform independence through the Java Virtual
        Machine (JVM).</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="js">12. JavaScript (1995):</h3>
    <p>Initially designed for web browsers, JavaScript evolved into a versatile language for both client and server-side
        development.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="r">13. Ruby (1995):</h3>
    <p>Ruby, influenced by Perl and Smalltalk, emphasized developer productivity and simplicity.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="c#">14. C# (2000):</h3>
    <P>Developed by Microsoft, C# combined features of C++ and Java and became a key language for Windows development.
    </P>
    <br>

    <h3 id="rt">15. Rust (2010):</h3>
    <p>Rust prioritizes memory safety without sacrificing performance, making it suitable for systems programming.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="s">16. Swift (2014):</h3>
    <p>Apple inroduced Swift as a modern replacement for Objective-C, focusing on safety, performance, and ease of use
        in iOS and macOS development.</p>
